# Say Hello - Endpoint :wave:


**Name:** Elizabeth Trotter

**Mini Challenge Scope:** Designed my first API endpoint that receives user input and outputs a personalized greeting, such as "Hello, {user's name}." Utilized `Postman` to facilitate the `data retrieval process`.

This endpoint works good and does what it should, I just feel like it could be simplified. Also The HttpPost should be an HttpGet (info from Jacooz) so that instead of changing the info you are recieving the greeting. Lines 9-14 can just be removed and line 20 can be changed to say return "Hello, " + userName; but I do understand why you did it your way. Works well, good job!
